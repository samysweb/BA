\todo{Acknowledgements}
First of all, I would like to thank my advisors Marko Kleine BÃ¼ning and Prof. Dr. Sinz for allowing me to pursue this exciting project - I very much enjoyed to work on this new approach for bitvector SMT solving.
Furthermore, I'd like to thank Dominik Schreiber who contributed in sparking my interest in the field of logics and SAT solving.\\
On a more personal note I would like to thank Niklas Uhl who endured the task of reading my thesis draft and found several flaws in the text.
