\Abstract
Decision procedures for SMT problems based on the theory of bitvectors are a fundamental component in state-of-the-art software and hardware verifiers.
In this work, we investigate whether abstractions can help in solving such problems.
After a short survey of current abstraction techniques, we present a novel solving approach for the quantifier free bitvector theory (\texttt{QF\_BV} in SMT-LIB) based on incremental SMT solving and abstraction refinement.
We implement this approach in a prototype extending the SMT solver Boolector and evaluate its performance on the relevant benchmark subset of SMT COMP 2018.
In comparison to Boolector, the new approach shows superior performance for unsatisfiable benchmark instances, while being inferior for satisfiable instances.
Finally in future work, we propose various methods to further improve the performance, especially for satisfiable instances.
