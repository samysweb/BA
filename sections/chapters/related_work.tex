\label{ch:related_work}
While bit blasting (as described in the previous chapter) is the predominant approach for solving the QF\_BV theory and related theories, many approaches are being combined today in order to avoid bitblasting entire instances.
In this chapter a multitude of approaches used for solving the bitvector theory as well as solving related theories are being summarized.

\section{Boolector's Lemmas on Demand}
Short summary of what it is and what it does (based on UF lemmas on demand)
\section{UCLID}
Interleaving under- and overapproximations
Works for extracting unsat cores of under approximations that might be able to produce a contradiction in main problem
-> We will soon see that this methodology does not work for some of the concerned problems (specifically this methodology wouldn't yield good results for modmul given its the core size)
