Short summary of what it is and what it does
\section{UCLID}
Interleaving under- and overapproximations
Works for extracting unsat cores of under approximations that might be able to produce a contradiction in main problem
-> We will soon see that this methodology does not work for some of the concerned problems (specifically this methodology wouldn't yield good results for modmul given its the core size)
