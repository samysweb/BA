\section{Satisfiability Modulo Theory}
- What is it?
- SMT-LIB
- We use QF\_BV, QF\_ABV or QF\_AUFBV
$\mathcal{F}_{T}$ are the formulas in theory T e.g. $\mathcal{F}_{QF\_UFBV}$ are the formulas in QF\_UFBV theory
\section{Boolector}
Winner of QF\_BV in 2018 \todo{sure? source?}
\section{Counterexample guieded abstractrion refinement (CEGAR)}
\dots
\section{Lemmas on Demand}
Short summary of what it is and what it does
\section{UCLID}
Interleaving under- and overapproximations
Works for extracting unsat cores of under approximations that might be able to produce a contradiction in main problem
-> We will soon see that this methodology does not work for some of the concerned problems (specifically this methodology wouldn't yield good results for modmul given its the core size)
\section{Examined benchmarks}
- HardSMT
- QF\_BV benchmarks in SMTCOMP 18 -> only benchmarks containing mul, sdiv, srem
