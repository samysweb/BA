abstract="The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is well known in computational complexity, representing the first decision problem to be proved NP-complete. SAT is also often the subject of work in proof complexity. Besides its theoretical interest, SAT finds a wide range of practical applications. Moreover, SAT solvers have been the subject of remarkable efficiency improvements since the mid-1990s, motivating their widespread use in many practical applications including Bounded and Unbounded Model Checking. The success of SAT solvers has also motivated the development of algorithms for natural extensions of SAT, including Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Pseudo-Boolean constraints (PB), Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) which also see application in the model-checking context. This chapter first covers the organization of modern conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) SAT solvers, which are used in the vast majority of practical applications of SAT. It then reviews the techniques shown to be effective in modern SAT solvers.",

abstract="Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) refers to the problem of determining whether a first-order formula is satisfiable with respect to some logical theory. Solvers based on SMT are used as back-end engines in model-checking applications such as bounded, interpolation-based, and predicate-abstraction-based model checking. After a brief illustration of these uses, we survey the predominant techniques for solving SMT problems with an emphasis on the lazy approach, in which a propositional satisfiability (SAT) solver is combined with one or more theory solvers. We discuss the architecture of a lazy SMT solver, give examples of theory solvers, show how to combine such solvers modularly, and mention several extensions of the lazy approach. We also briefly describe the eager approach in which the SMT problem is reduced to a SAT problem. Finally, we discuss how the basic framework for determining satisfiability can be extended with additional functionality such as producing models, proofs, unsatisfiable cores, and interpolants.",
